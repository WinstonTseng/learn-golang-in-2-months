Exercise: Create a program that counts word frequencies in a string.

Day 5:

Functions and error handling.

Example: Write a function that validates user input and returns an error if it’s invalid.

Day 6:

Structs and methods.

Practice: Build a “Product” struct and create methods to calculate discounts.

Example: Create a simple package for basic mathematical operations.

Day 10:

Introduction to concurrency: Goroutines and channels.

Exercise: Write a program that calculates squares of numbers concurrently.

Day 11-12:

Work on a CLI project:

Example: Build a command-line tool to manage a to-do list.

Features: Add, remove, and view tasks.

Day 13:

Testing and debugging in Go (go test, fmt.Println vs log).
